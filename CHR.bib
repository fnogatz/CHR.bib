  booktitle={Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation},

  publisher={Springer},
  pages={94--111},
  abstract="Abstract simulation of one transition system by another is introduced as a means to simulate a potentially infinite class of similar transition sequences within a single transition sequence. This is useful for proving confluence under invariants of a given system, as it may reduce the number of proof cases to consider from infinity to a finite number. The classical confluence results for Constraint HThe invariant is formalizedandling Rules (CHR) can be explained in this way, using CHR as a simulation of itself. Using an abstract simulation based on a ground representation, we extend these results to include confluence under invariant and modulo equivalence, which have not been done in a satisfactory way before.",

title="Lightweight string reasoning in model finding",

year="2015",
volume="14",

pages="413--427",
abstract="Models play a key role in assuring software quality in the model-driven approach. Precise models usually require the definition of well-formedness rules to specify constraints that cannot be expressed graphically. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a de-facto standard to define such rules. Techniques that check the satisfiability of such models and find corresponding instances of them are important in various activities, such as model-based testing and validation. Several tools for these activities have been developed, but to our knowledge, none of them supports OCL string operations on scale that is sufficient for, e.g., model-based testing. As, in contrast, many industrial models do contain such operations, there is evidently a gap. We present a lightweight solver that is specifically tailored to generate large solutions for tractable string constraints in model finding, and that is suited to directly express the main operations of the OCL datatype String. It is based on constraint logic programming (CLP) and constraint handling rules, and can be seamlessly combined with other constraint solvers in CLP. We have integrated our solver into the EMFtoCSP model finder, and we show that our implementation efficiently solves several common string constraints on large instances.",

	abstract = {Despite its rising popularity as data format especially for web services, the software ecosystem around the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is not as widely distributed as that of XML. For both data formats there exist schema languages to specify the structure of instance documents, but there is currently no opportunity to translate already existing XML Schema documents into equivalent JSON Schemas.
		In this paper we introduce an implementation of a language translator. It takes an XML Schema and creates its equivalent JSON Schema document. Our approach is based on Prolog and CHR. By unfolding the XML Schema document into CHR constraints, it is possible to specify the concrete translation rules in a declarative way.},

abstract="Concurrent Constraint Programming (CCP) has been used over the last two decades as an elegant and expressive model for concurrent systems. It models systems of agents communicating by posting and querying partial information, represented as constraints over the variables of the system. This covers a vast variety of systems as those arising in biological phenomena, reactive systems, net-centric computing and the advent of social networks and cloud computing. In this paper we survey the main applications, developments and current trends of CCP.",

	Constraint Handling Rules, CHR, have proved to be effective for a large range of

	Typically, such an installation involves a large number of cooperating software components

	Using CHR's constraint stores for knowledge representation may be appealing from
	a theoretical point of view, but suffers from the
	inherent limitation of CHR, that a constraint store disappears immediately after a query has been evaluated.

	An extension to CHR is proposed, which allows different processes
	to reason over and maintain a common
	knowledge base represented as text files containing constraints.
	Constraints are automatically read from and written to the files before and after
	a query has been executed, which means that the intended
	style of programming deviates only very little
	from traditional CHR programming.

Next we propose and motivate an intriguing research thread that uses as source language a (non-natural but coupled with our framework, generatively very powerful) universal language of our own device.

	title = {Angelic {CHR}},
	crossref = {pchr11},
	pages={19--31},
	abstract = {
	Implementations of CHR follow a committed-choice forwardchaining
	execution model: the non-determinism of the abstract semantics
	is partly rened with extra-logical syntactic convention on the program
	order and possibly notations for weighted semantics (with priorities or
	probabilities), and partly left unspecied in the underlying compiler.
	This paper proposes an alternative execution model which explores all
	the possible choices, by opposition to the committed-choice strategy. This
	execution model is angelic in the sense that if there exists a successful
	execution strategy (with respect to a given observable), then this strategy
	will be found. Formally, the set of computed goals is complete with
	respect to the set of the logical consequences of the interpretation of the
	initial goal in linear logic. In practice, this paper introduces a new data
	representation for sets of goals, the derivation nets. Sharing strategies
	between computation paths can be dened for derivation nets to make
	execution algorithmically tracktable in some cases where a naive exploration
	would be exponential. Control for rened execution is recovered
	with the introduction of user constraints to encode sequencing, fully captured
	in the linear-logic interpretation. As a consequence of angelic execution,
	CHR rules become decomposable while preserving accessibility
	properties. This decomposability makes natural the denition in angelic

	CHR is a very versatile programming language that allows
	programmers to declaratively specify constraint solvers. An important
	part of the development of such solvers is in their testing and debugging
	phases. Current CHR implementations support those phases by offering
	tracing facilities with limited information. In this paper, we propose a
	new trace for CHR which contains enough information to analyze any
	aspects of CHR$^\vee$ execution at some general abstract level. This approach
	is based on the idea of generic trace. Such a trace is formally defined as
	an extension of the refined CHR$^\vee$ semantics. It is currently prototyped in a SWI
	Prolog based CHR implementation.

	Most earlier approaches to probabilistic abductive logic programming

	attempt to introduce such dependencies in a logic programming setting,

	Constraint Handling Rules, for specication and evaluation of probability
	distributions over dependent abducibles. It is shown that this principle
	integrates well with earlier work on probabilistic abduction based on
	CHR, generalizing it to handle such dependencies. We present our rst
	experiments with a working implementation that show the potential for
	interesting applications. On the other hand, our experience underlines

	In this paper, we present a model transformation approach

	Our model transformation preserves the semantics and is implemented
	using CHR. The result of the transformation is an UML state machine
	model based on the concept of compound transitions. Furthermore we
	provide an interpreter for those models which supports a comprehensive
	subset of UML state machine concepts, i. a. junction, fork, join.
	Our preliminary results show that state machine interpreters can prot
	from the former model transformation. It simplies certain aspects of the
	interpreter implementation and positively aects the performance of the

								Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a rule- and logic-based formalism and has established itself as an active research topic. In contrast to other rule-based approaches, CHR is both, a theoretical formalism related to first-order and linear-logic, and a practical rule-based programming language. Other rule- and logic-based approaches have been successfully embedded in CHR. For this reason, it is considered a candidate for a lingua-franca of such approaches. We investigate CHR´s suitability for this purpose exemplarily, by considering an embedding of graph transformation systems (GTSs) in CHR, which helps us in identifying points of improvements for strengthening the lingua-franca argument further. In particular, we present a novel formulation of the operational semantics of CHR, which is founded on an equivalence relation over CHR states. It justifies the perspective on CHR as a rule-based rewriting system of equivalence classes, which abstracts over infinitely many possible syntactic variations of a CHR state. Overall, this equivalence-based operational semantics provides a powerful formal analysis tool for CHR, which can significantly reduce proof complexity. The lingua-franca argument implies a potential for cross-fertilization of research. Hence, we revisit program analysis methods available in the CHR literature. Our extended methods apply an invariant to make implicit assumptions explicitly available during analysis, hence, effectively eliminating irrelevant states. The resulting methods are applicable to strictly larger classes of CHR programs and provide more promising approaches towards analyzing more complex programs. Finally, we compare program analysis methods in GTSs and CHR. We find that the adapted CHR confluence test, when applied to a GTS embedded in CHR, corresponds to a sufficient criterion for confluence of the GTS. Similarly, we introduce program equivalence for GTSs with a sufficient criterion based on the CHR program equivalence test.

We give test cases a denotational semantics by viewing them as specification predicates. This reformulation of test cases allows for relating test cases via refinement to specifications and programs. Having such a refinement order that integrates test cases, we develop a testing theory for fault-based testing.   As discussed in Chapter 1, fault-based testing uses test data designed to demonstrate the absence of a set of pre-specified faults. A well-known fault-based technique is mutation testing. In mutation testing, first, faults are injected into a program by altering (mutating) its source code. Then, test cases that can detect these errors are designed. The assumption is that other faults will be caught, too. In this chapter, we apply the mutation technique to both specifications and programs.},

The incomplete state is encoded by the constraints in Constraint Handling Rules (CHRs). However, the existing constrains in FLUX are not complete to cover all Fluent Calculus state formulas, which to some extent restricts the range of applications of FLUX. We address this problem by adding negative disjunction constraints into FLUX, which enhances the ability of FLUX to express incomplete states, and the correctness is proved using the semantics of the Fluent Calculus.

				Abstract: Graph transformation systems (GTS) and constraint handling rules (CHR) are non-deterministic rule-based state transition systems. CHR is well-known for its powerful confluence and program equivalence analyses, for which we provide the basis in this work to apply them to GTS. We give a sound and complete embedding of GTS in CHR, investigate confluence of an embedded GTS, and provide a program equivalence analysis for GTS via the embedding. The results confirm the suitability of CHR-based program analyses for other formalisms embedded in CHR.

		We observe that the various formulations of the operational semantics of Constraint Handling Rules proposed over the years fall into a spectrum ranging from the analytical to the pragmatic.

We propose a novel operational semantics, which has a strong analytical foundation, while featuring a terminating execution model. We prove its soundness and completeness with respect to existing analytical formulations and we compare its expressivity to that of various other formulations.

Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a high-level declarative programming language
based on multi-headed multiset rewrite rules,
combined with aspects of logic and constraint programming.
Originally designed for extending a host language with user-defined constraint solvers,
CHR has evolved into a powerful, elegant general-purpose language with a wide spectrum of application domains.

The goal of this dissertation is to further improve the practical usability of the CHR programming language. 
As a first step,
we therefore redesign the language's syntax, language features, and operational semantics
to allow a more high-level, declarative programming style.
Our streamlined CHR2 syntax allows for more natural, readable, and concise rule definitions.
The operational semantics of CHR2 programs is designed to be as non-deterministic as possible,
while still facilitating the effective execution control required for practical programming.
In line with the `what, not how' and `algorithm = logic + control' maxims of declarative programming,
the CHR2 system by default fully determines the execution strategy.
% 
When needed though,
the programmer may control the order in which rules and conjunctions are executed
using two orthogonal, familiar execution control constructs:
rule priorities and sequential conjunction.
Priorities are specified using symbolic priority constraints,
which are more flexible than earlier proposals, and offer a better separation of logic and control.

We furthermore extended CHR with expressive language abstractions called aggregates.
Aggregates are powerful, concise rule applicability conditions
that collect information from larger parts of the constraint store.
Well-known examples include \texttt{min}, \texttt{sum}, \texttt{count}, and \texttt{findall}.
Our proposed framework supports nested aggregate expressions, efficient incremental aggregate computation 
and application-tailored user-defined aggregates.
Aggregates eliminate the need for low-level encodings of aggregate computations commonly found in CHR programs.
The extended CHR language thus fully regains its high-level, declarative nature.

A next crucial aspect of the practical usability of any programming language
is the performance of its implementations.
Because CHR2 rules are written at a very high level of abstraction,
uncovering the optimal low-level execution steps required to evaluate them is very challenging. 
In the final part of the dissertation,
we therefore introduce, evaluate and refine many new and existing
analyses and optimisation techniques for CHR programs.
Two instances are discussed in more detail:
We revise CHR's compilation scheme to optimise the space consumption of recursive programs,
and develop novel techniques for optimal---both in space and in time---reapplication prevention of CHR propagation rules.

Lastly, for CHR to be really useful for practical applications,
CHR must be embedded in a mainstream host language.
We therefore developed K.U.Leuven JCHR, a state-of-the-art CHR system for Java.
The thesis addresses both the language design issues of integrating CHR with imperative host languages,
and the technical challenges faced when compiling CHR to imperative languages.
JCHR is currently one of the most complete and efficient CHR implementations available,
typically outperforming other rule-based systems by several orders of magnitude.
The next-generation \JCHRtwo\ system moreover is a first reference implementation
of the improved \CHRtwo\ language, extended with negation as absence.

		Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a committed-choice declarative
		language which has been originally designed for writing constraint solvers

		Recently the language has been extended by introducing

		The resulting language, called CHR$^{rp}$, 
		allows a better control over execution 
		while retaining a declarative and flexible style of programming.

		In this paper we study the expressive power of this language

		We first show that dynamic priorities do not augment

		Then we show that, when considering the theoretical operational semantics, 
		CHR$^{rp}$ is strictly more expressive than CHR. 
		This result is obtained by using a problem similar to the leader-election 
		to show that, under some conditions, there exists no encoding of CHR$^rp$ into CHR. 
		We also show, by using a similar technique, that the CHR language with the, 
		so called, refined semantics is more expressive power than CHR 
		with theoretical semantics and we extend some previous results 
		showing that CHR can not be encoded into Prolog.

		Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a general purpose, committed-choice declarative language which, differently from other similar languages, uses multi-headed (guarded) rules.
In this paper we prove that multiple heads augment the expressive power of the language. In fact, we first show that restricting to single head rules affects the Turing completeness of CHR, provided that the underlying signature (for the constraint theory) does not contain function symbols. Next we show that, also when considering generic constraint theories, under some rather reasonable assumptions it is not possible to encode CHR (with multi-headed rules) into a single-headed CHR language while preserving the semantics of programs. As a corollary we obtain that, under these assumptions, CHR can be encoded neither in (constraint) logic programming nor in pure Prolog.

	In the current paper, we discuss cycles in Constraint Handling Rules for the purpose of scaling termination proofs. In order to obtain a useful characterization, our approach differs from the ones used in other declarative languages, such as Logic Programming and Term Rewrite Systems. Due to multi-headed rules, the notion of a cycle is not in direct correspondence with the recursive calls of a program. Our characterization has to be more refined as we have to consider also partner constraints. Furthermore, a second, more challenging problem, due to the multi-set semantics of CHR, makes it unclear how cycles structurally compose. To tackle this problem, we develop a new abstraction for computations in CHR based on hypergraphs. On the basis of this abstraction, we define CHR constructs as a representation for sub-computations. These constructs introduce a concept of minimality and structural composability, making it is a useful abstraction. On the basis of this abstraction we define the meaning of a CHR cycle. These are special kinds of CHR constructs. We have developed a verification for detecting whether constructs are CHR cycles and for deriving the minimal CHR cycles of a program. We motivate why and how this will lead to scalable automated termination proof procedures for CHR.

	crossref = {piclp09},
	abstract = {
		Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) share
the feature to constrain the set of possible solutions to a program via integrity or CLP constraints.
These two frameworks have been merged in works by various authors, which developed efficient abductive proof-procedures empowered with constraint satisfaction techniques.
However, while almost all CLP languages provide algorithms for finding an optimal solution with respect to some objective function (and not just {\em any} solution), the issue has received little attention in ALP.

In this paper we show how optimisation meta-predicates can be included in  abductive proof-pro\-ce\-dures, achieving in this way a significant improvement to research and practical applications of abductive reasoning.

In the paper, we give the declarative and operational semantics of an abductive proof-procedure that encloses constraint optimization meta-predicates, and we prove soundness in the three-valued completion semantics.
In the proof-procedure, the abductive logic program can invoke optimisation meta-predicates, which can invoke abductive predicates, in a recursive way.

		Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a committed-choice declarative language which has been designed for writing constraint solvers. A CHR program consists of multiheaded guarded rules which allow to rewrite constraints into simpler ones until a solved form is reached.

CHR has received considerable attention, both from the practical and from the theoretical side. Nevertheless, due the use of multiheaded clauses, there are several aspects of the CHR semantics which have not been clarified yet. In particular, no compositional semantics for CHR has been defined so far.

In this article we introduce a fix-point semantics which characterizes the input/output behavior of a CHR program and which is and-compositional, that is, which allows to retrieve the semantics of a conjunctive query from the semantics of its components. Such a semantics can be used as a basis to define incremental and modular analysis and verification tools.

		The HM(X) system is a generalization of the Hindley/Milner system parameterized in the constraint domain X. Type inference is performed by generating constraints out of the program text, which are then solved by the domain-specific constraint solver X. The solver has to be invoked at the latest when type inference reaches a let node so that we can build a polymorphic type. A typical example of such an inference approach is Milner's algorithm W. We formalize an inference approach where the HM(X) type inference problem is first mapped to a CLP(X) program. The actual type inference is achieved by executing the CLP(X) program. Such an inference approach supports the uniform construction of type inference algorithms and has important practical consequences when it comes to reporting type errors. The CLP(X) style inference system, where X is defined by Constraint Handling Rules, is implemented as part of the Chameleon system.

We show that $T$ has at least one model and prove its completeness by giving not only a decision procedure, but a full first-order constraint solver that gives clear and explicit solutions for any first-order constraint satisfaction problem in $T$. The solver is given in the form of 16 rewriting rules that transform any first-order constraint $\Phi$ into an equivalent disjunction $/phi$ of simple formulas such that $\phi$ is either the formula $true$ or the formula $false$ or a formula having at least one free variable, being equivalent neither to $true$ nor to $false$ and where the solutions of the free variables are expressed in a clear and explicit way. The correctness of our rules implies the completeness of $T$. We also describe an implementation of our algorithm in CHR (Constraint Handling Rules) and compare the performance with an implementation in C++ and that of a recent decision procedure for decomposable theories.

		Today, two distinct direct approaches to prove termination of CHR programs exist. 
		The first approach, by T. Fr\"uhwirth, proves termination of CHR programs without propagation. 
		The second, by Voets et al., deals with programs that contain propagation. 
		It is however less powerful on programs without propagation. 
		In this paper, we present new termination conditions 
		that are strictly more powerful than those from previous approaches 
		and that are also applicable to a new class of programs. 
		Furthermore, we present a new representation for CHR states 
		for which size-decreases between consecutive states correspond to termination. 
		Both contributions are linked: 
		our termination conditions correspond to the existence of a well-founded order on the new state representation, 
		which decreases for consecutive computation states.

Functional dependencies are supported by both GHC and Hugs, while the most recent version of GHC also supports
type functions.
There is an enthusiastic and lively debate which feature shall make it into the next Haskell standard, Haskell-Prime.
Currently, further progress in the standardization appears to be stalled on this issue.

		This paper presents a theory of testing that integrates into Hoare and He’s Unifying Theory of Programming (UTP). We give test cases a denotational semantics by viewing them as specification predicates. This reformulation of test cases allows for relating test cases via refinement to specifications and programs. Having such a refinement order that integrates test cases, we develop a testing theory for fault-based testing.
		Fault-based testing uses test data designed to demonstrate the absence of a set of pre-specified faults. A well-known fault-based technique is mutation testing. In mutation testing, first, faults are injected into a program by altering (mutating) its source code. Then, test cases that can detect these errors are designed. The assumption is that other faults will be caught, too. In this paper, we apply the mutation technique to both, specifications and programs.
		Using our theory of testing, two new test case generation laws for detecting injected (anticipated) faults are presented: one is based on the semantic level of UTP design predicates, the other on the algebraic properties of a small programming language.

		Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a very-high-level declarative programming language 
		based on concurrent multiset rewrite rules that are conditional, multi-headed, and committed-choice. 
		Originally designed in the early 1990s as a special-purpose programming language 
		for adding user-defined constraint solvers to a host language, 
		CHR has evolved over the last decade into 
		a powerful and elegant general-purpose language with a wide spectrum of application domains.

		Computational complexity theory is the study of scalability 
		of computer programs in terms of the computational resources they require 
		--- in particular, time (cpu usage) and space (memory usage).

		In this dissertation we investigate the CHR programming language 
		from the point of view of computational complexity theory. 
		The first part introduces complexity theory, CHR, and CHR compilation. 
		In the second part, 
		we improve the state of the art by proposing and implementing several compiler optimizations. 
		We confirm experimentally that these optimizations improve both the time and space complexity of CHR programs.

		Finally, in the third part of this dissertation, we prove a ``complexity-wise completeness'' result. 
		We demonstrate that the CHR language and state-of-the-art CHR systems
		(that implement the compiler optimizations of the previous part) 
		are sufficiently efficient in the following precise sense: 
		\emph{every algorithm can be implemented in CHR 
		and be executed with the optimal asymptotic time and space complexity}.

		Constraint Programming (CP) is a high-level declarative programming paradigm 
		in which problems are modeled by means of constraints on the problem variables 
		that need to hold in all solutions to the problem. 
		Many problems of high practical relevance can easily be described in terms of constraints. 
		Example application areas include production planning and crew scheduling. 
		A constraint programming system contains a constraint solver 
		whose task it is to find valuations for the problem variables that satisfy all constraints.

		Constraint programming systems can be classified 
		by the variable domains and types of constraints their solver supports. 
		However, for many problems it is not so straightforward 
		to create a model in terms of basic constraint domains. 
		Therefore, on the one hand, systems emerged that can handle more specialized constraint domains. 
		On the other hand, facilities were designed 
		that make it easier to implement an application-specific constraint solver. 
		Some notable examples of these facilities are attributed variables, and Constraint Handling Rules.

		Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a rule-based language, 
		designed for the implementation of application-specific constraint solvers. 
		CHR is a very flexible language for the specification of a constraint solvers' logic, 
		but flexible execution control is almost completely lacking. 
		Execution control is of great importance for the efficiency of CP systems. 
		However, so far, the problem of execution control has received 
		only very limited attention in the context of CHR. 
		In this thesis, we propose a solution to the problem of execution control in CHR. 
		In particular, we extend CHR with high-level facilities to support the specification of execution strategies.

		More precisely, we extend CHR with user-defined rule priorities into CHR$^\mathrm{rp}$. 
		CHR rules correspond to constraint propagators, 
		and so rule priorities enable the specification of propagation strategies. 
		An optimized implementation of CHR$^\mathrm{rp}$ is presented and evaluated empirically. 
		Next, we extend CHR with facilities for search strategy control. 
		Our approach combines CHR$^\vee$ (CHR with disjunction) 
		and CHR$^\mathrm{rp}$ into a new language called CHR$_\vee^\mathrm{brp}$
		in which the propagation strategy is determined by means of rule priorities, 
		and the search strategy by means of branch priorities. 
		We propose a framework for analyzing the time complexity of CHR$^\mathrm{rp}$ programs, 
		by combining the Logical Algorithms framework (LA) of Ganzinger and McAllester with CHR$^\mathrm{rp}$. 
		We present translation schemas from and to LA 
		and propose an alternative implementation for CHR$^\mathrm{rp}$ with strong complexity guarantees. 
		Finally, we investigate the join order optimization problem, 
		which is an important aspect of optimized CHR compilation. 
		We propose a cost model for matching multi-headed rules, 
		approximations of its parameters, and methods to find an optimal join order. 
		An extension of the model for CHR$^\mathrm{rp}$ is given.

		non-termination, CHR implementations ensure a CHR rule is applied
		at most once with the same combination of constraints by maintaining
		a so-called propagation history. The performance impact of this history
		is often significant. We introduce two optimizations to reduce or even
		eliminate this overhead, and evaluate their implementation in two 
		state-of-the-art CHR systems.

		(\emph{ask}) checks by CHRat rules for each constraint. We define the operational
		and declarative semantics of CHRat, provide a transformation of

	abstract = {
		This thesis intends to investigate two aspects of Constraint Handling Rules (CHR). 
		It proposes a compositional semantics and a technique for program transformation. 
		CHR is a concurrent committed-choice constraint logic programming language consisting of guarded rules, 
		which transform multi-sets of atomic formulas (constraints) into simpler ones until exhaustion 
		and it belongs to the declarative languages family. 
		It was initially designed for writing constraint solvers
		but it has recently also proven to be a general purpose language, being as it is Turing equivalent. 
		Compositionality is the first CHR aspect to be considered. 
		A trace based compositional semantics for CHR was previously defined. 
		The reference operational semantics for such a compositional model 
		was the original operational semantics for CHR which, 
		due to the propagation rule, admits trivial non-termination. 
		In this thesis we extend the above mentioned work
		by introducing a more refined trace based compositional semantics 
		which also includes the history. 
		The use of history is a well-known technique in CHR which permits us 
		to trace the application of propagation rules 
		and consequently it permits trivial non-termination avoidance. 
		Naturally, the reference operational semantics, of our new compositional one, 
		uses history to avoid trivial non-termination too. 
		Program transformation is the second CHR aspect to be considered, 
		with particular regard to the unfolding technique. 
		Said technique is an appealing approach which allows us to optimize a given program 
		and in more detail to improve run-time efficiency or space-consumption. 
		Essentially it consists of a sequence of syntactic program manipulations 
		which preserve a kind of semantic equivalence called qualified answer, 
		between the original program and the transformed ones. 
		The unfolding technique is one of the basic operations 
		which is used by most program transformation systems. 
		It consists in the replacement of a procedure-call by its definition. 
		In CHR every conjunction of constraints can be considered as a procedure-call, 
		every CHR rule can be considered as a procedure 
		and the body of said rule represents the definition of the call. 
		While there is a large body of literature on transformation and unfolding of sequential programs, 
		very few papers have addressed this issue for concurrent languages. 
		We define an unfolding rule, show its correctness and discuss some conditions 
		in which it can be used to delete an unfolded rule 
		while preserving the meaning of the original program. 
		Finally, confluence and termination maintenance between the original and transformed programs are shown.

		Next, we show why this compilation scheme is not suited for compilation to an imperative host language such as Java.
		We therefore introduce a novel compilation scheme from CHR to Java

		The empirical evaluation of the improved compilation scheme

		In this paper, 
		we address the different conceptual and technical difficulties 
		encountered when embedding CHR into an imperative host language. 
		We argue that a tight, natural integration leads to a powerful programming language extension, 
		intuitive to both CHR and imperative programmers. 
		We show how to compile CHR to highly optimized imperative code. 
		To this end, we first review the well-established CHR compilation scheme, 
		and survey the large body of possible optimizations. 
		We then show that this scheme, when used for compilation to imperative target languages, 
		leads to stack overflows. 
		We therefore introduce new optimizations that considerably improve the performance of recursive CHR programs. 
		Rules written using tail calls are even guaranteed to run in constant space. 
		We implemented systems for both Java and C, 
		following the language design principles and compilation scheme presented in this paper, 
		and show that our implementations outperform other state-of-the-art CHR compilers by several orders of magnitude.

		The union-find algorithm can be seen as solving simple equations between variables or constants. 
		With a few lines of code change, we generalise its implementation in CHR from equality to arbitrary binary relations. 
		By choosing the appropriate relations, we can derive fast incremental algorithms 
		for solving certain propositional logic (SAT) problems and polynomial equations in two variables. 
		In general, we prove that when the relations are bijective functions, our generalisation yields a correct algorithm. 
		We also show that bijectivity is a necessary condition for correctness if the relations include the identity function.

		The rules of our generic algorithm have additional properties that make them suitable for incorporation into constraint solvers: 
		from classical union-find, they inherit a compact solved form and quasi-linear time and space complexity. 
		By nature of CHR, they are anytime and online algorithms. 
		They solve and simplify the constraints in the problem, 
		and can test them for entailment, even when the constraints arrive incrementally.

		This paper explores an approach to design for verification in systems built atop a middleware framework which separates synchronization concerns from the ``core-functional logic'' of a program. The framework is based on a language-independent compositional model of synchronization contracts, called Szumo, which integrates well with popular OO design artifacts and provides strong guarantees of non-interference for a class of strictly exclusive systems. An approach for extracting models from Szumo design artifacts and analyzing the generated models to detect deadlocks is described. A key decision was to use Constraint Handling Rules to express the semantics of synchronization contracts, which allowed a transparent model of the implementation logic.

	Adaptive constraint processing with Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) 
	allows the application of intelligent search strategies to
	solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), but these search algorithms
	have to be implemented in the host language of adaptive CHR,
	which is currently Java. On the other hand, CHR$^\vee$ enables to explicitly
	formulate search in CHR, using disjunctive bodies to model choices.
	However, a naive implementation for handling disjunctions, in particular
	chronological backtracking (as implemented in Prolog) might cause
	"thrashing" due to an inappropriate order of decisions. To avoid this, a
	first combination of adaptive CHR and CHR$^\vee$ is presented to offer a more
	efficient embedded search mechanism to handle disjunctions. Therefore
	the refined operational semantics of CHR is extended for disjunctions
	and adaptation.

	The challenges of the Semantic Web endeavour in knowledge

	conceptual simplicity and tractability. Even though constraint-based programming
	has a tradition of tackling these questions, constraint-based
	rule formalisms such as constraint logic programming, concurrent constraint
	programming, constraint databases and constraint handling rules
	(CHR) have not explicitely been considered for combination with DL yet.
	The same holds for concurrency, which is an essential characteristic of
	the internet, but to the best of our knowledge has not been related to DL
	so far. Since CHR is a very expressive declarative concurrent constraintbased
	programming language with optimal performance guarantee and
	other interesting properties, we explore in this speculative paper what a
	CHR-based approach would look like in comparison to recent approaches

	title = {Modelling Scoped Instances with Constraint Handling Rules},
	abstract = {
		Haskell's class system provides a programmer with a mechanism to implicitly pass parameters to a function. A class predicate over some type variable in the type signature of a function induces the obligation for the caller to implicitly pass an appropriate instance of the class to the function. The class system is programmed by providing class instances for concrete types, thus providing, for each class, a unique mapping from types to instances. This mapping is used whenever an instance for a class predicate over some type is required. Choosing which instance to pass is solely based on the instantiated type of the class predicate.
Although this mechanism has proved to be powerful enough for modelling overloading and a plethora of other programming language concepts, it is still limited in the sense that multiple instances for a type cannot exist at the same time. Usually one can program around this limitation by introducing dummy types, which act as a key to map to additional instances; but this indirect way of allowing extra instances clutters a program and still is bound to the finite number of types statically available in a program. The latter restriction makes it impossible to dynamically construct instances, which, for example, depend on runtime values.
In this paper we lift these restrictions by means of local instances. Local instances allow us to shadow existing instances by new ones and to construct instances inside functions, using function arguments. We provide a translation of class and instance definitions to Constraint Handling Rules, making explicit the notion of ``scope of an instance'' and its role in context reduction for instances. We deal with the ambiguity of choosing between instances by using a framework for heuristically choosing between otherwise overlapping instances.

		A number of information systems can be described as a set of
interacting entities, which must follow interaction protocols. These
protocols determine the behaviour and the properties of the overall
system, hence it is of the uttermost importance that the entities
behave in a conformant manner.

A typical case is that of multi-agent systems, composed of a
plurality of agents without a centralized control. Compliance to
protocols can be hardwired in agent programs; however, this requires
that only ``certified'' agents interact. In open systems, composed
of autonomous and heterogeneous entities whose internal structure
is, in general, not accessible (open agent societies being, again, a
prominent example) interaction protocols should be specified in
terms of the \textit{observable} behaviour, and compliance should be
verified by an external entity.

In this paper, we propose a Java-Prolog-CHR system for
verification of compliance of computational entities to protocols
specified in a logic-based formalism (\textit{Social Integrity
Constraints}). We also show the application of the formalism and the
system to the specification and verification of three different
scenarios: two specifications show the feasibility of our approach
in the context of Multi Agent Systems (FIPA Contract-Net Protocol
and Semi-Open societies), while a third specification applies to the
specification of a lower level protocol (Open-Connection phase of
the TCP protocol).

		The need for processing biological information is rapidly growing, owing to the masses of new information in digital form being produced at this time. Old methodologies for processing it can no longer keep up with this rate of growth. The methods of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general and of language processing in particular can offer much towards solving this problem. However, interdisciplinary research between language processing and molecular biology is not yet widespread, partly because of the effort needed for each specialist to understand the other one's jargon. We argue that by looking at the problems of molecular biology from a language processing perspective, and using constraint based logic methodologies we can shorten the gap and make interdisciplinary collaborations more effective. We shall discuss several sequence analysis problems in terms of constraint based formalisms such Concept Formation Rules, Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) and their grammatical counterpart, CHRG. We postulate that genetic structure analysis can also benefit from these methods, for instance to reconstruct from a given RNA secondary structure, a nucleotide sequence that folds into it. Our proposed methodologies lend direct executability to high level descriptions of the problems at hand and thus contribute to rapid while efficient prototyping.

		In this project, I test the the mean-variance Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. I employ two datasets which consist of 25 portfolios formed on size and the book equity to market equity ratio and 11 portfolios formed on dividend yield. I also divide the whole period into two to consider the sub-period effects. I employ the cross-sectional tests as well as the multivariate time-series tests for both of the models. The results do not unambiguously show that one model fits better than the other. Moreover, the two sub-period results are inconsistent with each other and with the results from the whole period.

	CHR. It is provably correct and confluent. 
	It is independent of the underlying constraint system, and therefore not
	restricted to finite domains. We also show completeness of
	constraint propagation, i.e. that all possible consequences of the constraint
	are generated by the implementation. Our algorithm is encoded by three pairs of
	rules, two corresponding to base cases, two performing the obvious traversal of
	the sequences to be compared and two covering a not so obvious special case when
	the lexicographic constraint has a unique solution.

	A new integration of Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) and

	and by full compliance to the refined operational semantics. Flexibility is
	the result of a well thought-out design, allowing e.g. an easy integration

		We propose a generic type system for the Constraint Handling Rules (CHR),

	language is a constraint logic programming language, typed with the prescriptive
	type system we developed in our previous work. In particular,
	we show the consistency of the resulting type system w.r.t. the extended
	execution model CLP+CHR. This system is implemented through an

		The programming language of Constraint Handling Rules (CHR)
	is gaining more and more popularity and this has
	motivated the development of new optimization
	techniques to be applied in implementations of CHR.
	As for other logic programming languages,
	a program written CHR can be understood declaratively
	as a logical formula and as a procedural specification,
	and CHR has different tools for manual optimization
	at the procedural level whose application may (or may not)
	sacrifice the declarative reading.
	One such optimization is given by passive declarations
	by means of which the search for rules to be applied can
	be optimized, perhaps changing which rules that are applied
	and in which order.
	A framework for analyzing the effect of passive declarations
	is presented in terms of a slightly abstract operational
	semantics which takes into account the effect of passive
	declarations. Based on it, we can give different classifications
	of the effect of some passive declarations that do not affect
	the logical semantics.
	This may be used for reasoning about manual optimizations
	as well as proposals for automatic strategies to be applied
	by a compiler for adding passive declarations.

		The spiraling nature of evolutionary software development

		It is argued that these parts should consist not only of programming language code,

		As a main benefit of the use of more abstract, yet formal, modeling languages, 
		a method for model based test sequence generation for reactive systems on the grounds of Constraint Logic Programming 
		as well as its implementation in the CASE tool AF is presented.

		In fact, Chameleon's entire type inference system and evidence translation of programs is phrased 
		in terms of CHRs.

	We present an optimisation for Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) that reduces the amount of variables a constraint delays on. 
	This optimisation reduces the overhead of delaying on variables as well as the needless reawakening of delayed constraint.

	A correctness proof of the optimisation based on the refined operational semantics 
	establishes the validity of the optimisation and sheds light on possible extensions as well as related optimisations.

	The delay avoidance optimisation shows good speedups for some programs and no noticable slowdown for others.

		A qualitative representational model and the corresponding reasoning process for integrating time and topological information is developed in this paper. In the calculus presented, topological information in function of the point of the time in which it is true is represented as an instance of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem. The resulting method can be applied to qualitative navigation of autonomous agents. The model presented in this paper will help us during the path planning task by describing the sequence of topological situations that the agent should find during its way to the target objective. A preliminary result of that application has been obtained by using qualitative representation of such spatial aspects for the autonomous simulated navigation of a Nomad-200 robot, on a structured environment of an easy corridor in a building.

		Intelligent Information Integration (I3) aims at combining heterogeneous and distributed information sources by explicitly representing and reasoning about their content, giving the user the illusion of interacting with a uniform system. In this paper we show how query planning in such a system can be reduced to a constraint handling problem. Conceptually, our approach relies on a generalized abductive reasoning mechanism involving so called partially open predicates, which support a seamless combination of backward (goal-directed) and forward reasoning. The original aspects of our approach consist in the early detection of (plan) inconsistencies using forward propagation of constraints as well as in the seamless interleaving of query planning and execution. Unlike other specialized query planning algorithms, for which domain reasoning and query planning are only loosely coupled, our encoding of source and domain models into Constraint Handling Rules allows us to fully and efficiently exploit existing domain knowledge. The ability to automatically derive source interactions from domain models (ontologies) enhances the flexibility of modeling.

		While there are efforts to establish a single international accounting standard, there are strong current and future needs to handle heterogeneous accounting methods and systems. We advocate a context-based approach to dealing with multiple accounting standards and equational ontological conflicts. In this paper we first define what we mean by equational ontological conflicts and then describe a new approach, using Constraint Logic Programming and abductive reasoning, to reconcile such conflicts among disparate information systems. In particular, we focus on the use of Constraint Handling Rules as a simultaneous symbolic equation solver, which is a powerful way to combine, invert and simplify multiple conversion functions that translate between different contexts. Finally, we demonstrate a sample application using our prototype implementation that demonstrates the viability of our approach.

		With the aim of automatically reasoning with spatial aspects in a cognitive way, several qualitative models have been developed in recent years. However, there is no model to reason with several spatial aspects in a uniform way. Moreover, most of these models simplify spatial objects to points. In this paper we present the use of constraint logic programming instantiated to finite domains extended with constraint handling rules as a tool for successfully integrating the qualitative concepts of orientation, distance, and cardinal directions, using points as well as extended objects as a primitive of reasoning. The resulting model has been applied to build a demonstrator: a qualitative navigation simulator on the structured environment of our city.

		This paper discusses the algorithm we are using for the mediation of queries to disparate information sources in a Context Interchange system, where information sources may have different interpretations arising from their respective context. Queries are assumed to be formulated without regard for semantic heterogeneity, and are rewritten to corresponding mediated queries by taking into account the semantics of data codified in axioms associated with sources and receivers (the corresponding context theories). Our approach draws upon recent advances in abductive logic programming and presents an integration of techniques for query rewriting and semantic query optimization. We also demonstrate how this can be efficiently implemented using the constraint logic programming system ECLiPSe.

		People in their cars, people in the street, people at work, people at home--communicating through their mobile phones. Wireless communication might be the trend of the nineties, and it definitely means big business for the telecommunication industry. In Germany, for example, every third phone sold today is mobile. In the US, there will soon be 20 million subscribers to cellular phone services. In the second half of the nineties, 20% to 30% of phones sold worldwide are expected to be wireless .

The introduction of a European standard for digital cordless telecommunication has made cordless local area networks possible. Mobile communication can come to company sites. No cabling is required, and the employees can be reached anytime at any place. However, planning wireless digital networks is quite different from planning traditional wire-based systems. The plan must account for the specifics of radio-wave propagation at the installation site. Computer-aided planning promises to ease some of the difficulties.

In this article, we describe Popular (Planning of Picocellular Radio), a prototype tool resulting from a collaboration of industry and research institutions in Germany: the Siemens Research and Development Department, the Siemens Personal Networks Department, the European Computer-Industry Research Center (ECRC), and the Institute of Communication Networks at the Aachen University of Technology. Popular uses a path-loss model to describe radio-wave transmission and constraint-based programming to optimize the placement of base stations (transmitters) for local wireless communication at company sites.

		We introduce the notion of confluence for Constraint Handling Rules (CHR), a powerful language for writing constraint solvers. With CHR one simplifies and solves constraints by applying rules. Confluence guarantees that a CHR program will always compute the same result for a given set of constraints independent of which rules are applied. We give a decidable, sufficient and necessary syntactic condition for confluence.
		Confluence turns out to be an essential syntactical property of CHR programs for two reasons. First, confluence implies correctness (as will be shown in this paper). In a correct CHR program, application of CHR rules preserves logical equivalence of the simplified constraints. Secondly, even when the program is already correct, confluence is highly desirable. Otherwise, given some constraints, one computation may detect their inconsistency while another one may just simplify them into a still complex constraint.
		As a side-effect, the paper also gives soundness and completeness results for CHR programs. Due to their special nature, and in particular correctness, these theorems are stronger than what holds for the related families of (concurrent) constraint programming languages.
